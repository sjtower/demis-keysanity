# Lunky World

Lunky World is a collection of 42 varied challenges that feature many custom enemies, blocks, and mechanics. It is designed for a high-level Spelunky player, but it is more forgiving than a traditional Kaizo-style mod.  

* **42** varied custom levels using traps and enemies from all major biomes  
* **6** boss fights featuring customized enemies such as Quillback, mummies, and lavamanders  
* **4** health lets you make a few mistakes and still finish  
* Loads of custom tiles - Expect new mechanics with almost every level  
* Save automatically on death, a dev door to teleport to any level, and instant retry on death  
* Levels designed around items such as climbing gloves, shotguns, capes, and
