# Obstacles

From @Cynichill

Stay in the air by jumping on eggy people & jetpack (DONE)

a speedrun level using the traps could be fun, for a unique timer you could use a poisoned mount

Lahamu but you use push blocks to cover and uncover those.. upward laser trap things to bounce ufos into her? (DONE kinda)

Space invaders-type UFO level - kill with forcefield (DONE)

Don't cook the turkey - mounts can ride death blocks

shooting a bubbled enemy with another bubble pushes the bubble away

Defend against fish barrage - tidepool 3

If water makes you immune to magma men, you could do something like having pools of water as safety zones the player has to reach between magma men hell. Could use rock dogs

Throw bodies at spark traps to trigger far away stuff & weird angles

vertical level about guiding the bubble to the top without popping
